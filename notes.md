# Open Data Symposium

## Outline
Date: Late summer/Early Fall
Timeframe: 2 days
Public: Inivitees (PIs, Senior Staff), open to students/postdocs
Attendees: aim for 50+ positive RSVPs
Location: MIT McGovern Brain Research Institute
43 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA
Area coverage: US-wide

# Schedule
- Panel discussion for each session on challenges.
- No discussion session after individual talks
- Full discussion in the panel discussion.

## Sessions:

### I. Data Representation
* Scientific Data Formats (e.g. TileDB, HDF5, Zarr,...)
* Standards (e.g. BIDS)
* Validation (e.g. BIDS AND/OR NWB AND/OR DANDI)

### II. Data Sources
* Measurement Devices (open data acquisition question — e.g. openephys OR Bruker+NIfTI)
* Simulated Data (e.g. VirtualBrain/EBRAINS OR CircuitData/BiophysModel from Krembil OR MCell)
* High throughput acquisition (and resulting big data challenges — e.g. Ca Imaging/Janelia OR Connectome/Harvard, MultielectrodeArrays/Maxwell Biosystem)

### III. Infrastructure
(maybe make inidividual topics a bit more specific)
* Software environments (e.g. datalad AND/OR package managers)
* Cloud storage and access (e.g. TileDB OR AWS)
* High Performance Computing (e.g. efficient parallelization AND/OR GPU optimization)

### IV. Research Output
* Software (e.g. AFNI AND/OR nipy AND/OR fmriprep AND/OR ANTs AND/OR neuralEnsemble/EBRAINS)
* Analysis (e.g. Dimensionality Reduction AND/OR Multiscale integration)
* Publishing (e.g. JOSS AND/OR bioRxiv AND/OR Zenodo)

### V. Big Picture
* Discovery Workflows (how do open data elements integrate in the overarching research process — e.g. Scientific Machine Learning ecosystem AND/OR Physics-informed NN for data analyses)
* Resilience and Sustainability (e.g. FSF OR OSI)

# Invitations

## Pre-invitees List

Rationale: Have a number of confirmed speakers for when we send invitations out to people who may decline out of prominence concerns.

* Yaro
* Satra/Dorota
* Fabian Voigt (Mesospim → http://mesospim.org/ )

## Invitees List

Send out an email with a link to the schedule (sessions and confirmed speakers)

## Important considerations

### Funding

Available for speakers and organizers, **not** available for attendees.

### Location: Auditorium at MIT TBD (Nima)
- singleton auditorium for the symposium talks

### Open Questions

Answered:
A. Accommodation for speakers? Budget? YES
B. Would budget suffice to invite a speaker from Europe who works on EBRAINS? YES
C. Funding sufficient to provide snacks for tutorial days? YES

Need to know:
D. Do we need industry sponsors?
C. Domain name good?

### Later

a. Communications platform (mattermost, slack, element?)
b. Landing Page — Nima can make the domain, Christian can make the page (opendatasymposium.mit.edu).

# Progress

0. TODO Determine exact date
1. TODO Write example invitation email, substantiating the focus (HC)
2. TODO Make logo
3. TODO determine room availability and annotate rooms and location above (ND,SG,DJ)

## Notes

Integrate with, ideally create time slots for:
* BossDB
* NIMO
* BIL
* DANDI

* OpenNeuro
* NIMAR (Uses openneuro)
* OpenNeuro-PET (uses openneuro)
* DABI

3 hr session
1.45 hr lunch
3 hr session
